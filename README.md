# Nudger
A swiftUI app for developing new positive habits.

To do:

Fix dates:
For some reason, when I change day in the nudgesView, nudges created day doesn't always show up.
I think it has something to do with date conversion between swift and firebase.

Fix crash if a notification has already been deleted when you try to delete a nudge. (If the nudge is left
on the database for some reason, but the notification has been deleted.)

Implement some kind of statistics view.

Over all, try to make it look nicer. Maybe add some color, for example.
