                    // individual rowViews won't update.
                    // (I was checking whether the selected date was in doneDates before. Now, that approach also works,
                    // but I use the stored doneThisDay instead to at least pretend it serves a purpose.)
                    
                    // I think this has to do with the way forEach works - since the structs are the same unless I re-create them reading
                    // from firestore, the rowViews won't update. Maybe. But on the other hand, I thought structs were copy-by-value,
                    // and since I re-create currentNudges each time I select a date, it should be new objects. But, wasn't there something
                    // about copying not occuring until one actually changed a value?! Complicated...
